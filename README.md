This is a collaborative, realtime brainstorming application designed to help teams work together seamlessly in what I call "Pods".

Think of it as your digital war room where you can whiteboard, chat, video call, and manage tasks all in one beautiful, dark-themed interface. I'm going for a super modern, "next-gen" look with a touch of teal.
